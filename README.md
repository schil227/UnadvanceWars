UnadvanceWars
=============

Teaching myself ruby through game development! "UnadvanceWars" is my project based off of the game "Advance Wars", made by Intelligent Systems. I unfortunately hadn't set up Subversion control when I started because of instalation issues, but better late then never!

To run UnadvanceWars, open main.rb either in terminal with `ruby main.rb` or by double clicking the file (if the .rb extention is associated with ruby). The game also requires the rubygame gem to run, which can be installed by calling `gem install rubygame` 

Any feedback given will be greatly appreciated. It is still in development, but boy is it fun to move things around!

Thank you and Enjoy
